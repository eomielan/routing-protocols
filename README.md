# Routing Protocols

## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the link state and distance vector routing protocols. There are two separate programs: one that implements the link state protocol, and one that implements the distance vector protocol. Both programs read and use the same file format for the networkâ€™s topology as well as the same format for messages to send.

## Instructions

1. Run `chmod +x dvr.sh lsr.sh setup.sh` to make the scripts executable.
2. Run `python3 -m venv myenv` and then `source myenv/bin/activate` to start a virtual environment.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the virtual environment to install dependencies.
4. To start a simulation, run one of the following commands:

    #### Distance Vector Routing Protocol

    ```
    ./dvr.sh <topologyFile> <messageFile> <changesFile> [outputFile]
    ```

    Example:

    ```
    ./dvr.sh topology.txt message.txt changes.txt
    ```

    #### Link State Routing Protocol:

    ```
    ./lsr.sh <topologyFile> <messageFile> <changesFile> [outputFile]
    ```

    Example:

    ```
    ./lsr.sh topology.txt message.txt changes.txt
    ```

5. Run `pytest` to run the tests.
    
    **NOTE:** The tests require `dos2unix` to run on Linux. If you do not already have this package installed please run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install dos2unix
    ```

6. Run `deactivate` to stop the virtual environment.

## Testing

We used [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/), a Python testing framework, to test our code. These test files can be found in the `src/test` directory.

To run the test suite:

1. Ensure you have Pytest installed.
2. In the command line, run `pytest` to start the test suite.

Note that you can run the test suite from the root or `src/test` directory. The root directory rely on the bash scripts to run, while running the tests from `src/test` do not require the bash scripts.
