# Routing Protocols

## Overview

This project is a Python implementation of the link state and distance vector routing protocols. There are two separate programs: one that implements the link state protocol, and one that implements the distance vector protocol. Both programs read and use the same file format for the networkâ€™s topology as well as the same format for messages to send.

The documentation for this project was generated using Doxygen and can be found by opening `doxygen/html/index.html` in a browser. If there are any issues viewing the documentation, follow these steps to generate it locally:

1. Install [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).
2. In the command line, navigate to the doxygen directory using `cd doxygen`.
3. Next, run `doxygen Doxyfile` to generate the documentation.
4. The documentation can be viewed by opening the file `doxygen/html/index.html` in a browser.

## Instructions

1. Run `chmod +x dvr.sh lsr.sh setup.sh` once before running the programs.
2. Run `python3 -m venv myenv` and then `source myenv/bin/activate` to start a virtual environment.
3. Run `./setup.sh` in the virtual environment to install dependencies.

    **NOTE:** If you encounter the following error when running `./setup.sh`:

    ```
    ./setup.sh: line 2: $'\r': command not found
    ./setup.sh: line 20: syntax error: unexpected end of file
    ```

    First run `dos2unix setup.sh` to convert the line endings in `setup.sh` to Unix-style line endings, then run `./setup.sh` again.

4. To start a simulation, run one of the following commands:

    #### Distance Vector Routing Protocol

    ```
    ./dvr.sh <topologyFile> <messageFile> <changesFile> [outputFile]
    ```

    Example:

    ```
    ./dvr.sh topology.txt message.txt changes.txt
    ```

    #### Link State Routing Protocol:

    ```
    ./lsr.sh <topologyFile> <messageFile> <changesFile> [outputFile]
    ```

    Example:

    ```
    ./lsr.sh topology.txt message.txt changes.txt
    ```

5. Run `pytest` to run the tests.
    
    **NOTE:** The tests require dos2unix to run on Linux. If you do not already have this package installed please run the following:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install dos2unix
    ```

6. Run `deactivate` to stop the virtual environment.

## Testing

We used [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/), a Python testing framework, to test our code. These test files can be found in the `src/test` directory.

To run the test suite:

1. Ensure you have Pytest installed.
2. In the command line, run `pytest` to start the test suite.

Note that you can run the test suite from the root or `src/test` directory. The root directory rely on the bash scripts to run, while running the tests from `src/test` do not require the bash scripts.
